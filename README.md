# UNICEF Education Data Analysis

This project provides an analysis of UNICEF education data, exploring trends and disparities across various countries, gender, wealth quintiles, and urban-rural areas while leveragingR for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to uncover insights for education policy, NGO interventions, and international organizations on education.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: The dataset includes information on education indicators for multiple countries, categorized by demographic attributes like gender, wealth, residence, and time period.
- **Analysis**: The analysis is organized into research questions focusing on disparities in education completion rates, trends over time, and country-specific comparisons.
- **Visualizations**: Comprehensive visualizations provide a clear representation of the findings, with options to view data across gender, wealth levels, and residence type.

## Research Questions

1. What are the completion rates across different educational levels for males and females in various countries?
2. How do education completion rates vary by wealth quintile within each country?
3. Are there significant differences in education outcomes between urban and rural areas?
4. How have educational indicators evolved over time across different countries or regions?
